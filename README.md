# IoT Smart Grain Storage Monitor – PIR, DHT11 & MQ Sensor Module

## Description
This project demonstrates a multi-sensor IoT simulation using Tinkercad.
It is a part of a Smart Grain Storage Monitoring and Pest Control system
designed to reduce post-harvest losses in rural storage facilities.

## Sensors Used
- PIR Sensor – Detects rodent movement
- DHT11 Sensor – Measures temperature and humidity
- MQ Gas Sensor – Detects spoilage-related gases

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno (Simulated in Tinkercad)
- PIR Motion Sensor
- DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
- MQ Gas Sensor
- LED & Resistor
- Breadboard

## Working
- PIR sensor detects rodent movement inside storage
- DHT11 monitors temperature and humidity conditions
- MQ gas sensor detects gases released during spoilage
- Arduino processes sensor data
- LED turns ON when pest activity or spoilage is detected
- This indicates an alert condition in grain storage

## Application
This module is used for detecting rodent movement in traditional grain storage
facilities to reduce post-harvest losses and helps in early detection of pest activity and spoilage
in traditional grain storage facilities and supports automated
pest control actions in an IoT-based architecture.
