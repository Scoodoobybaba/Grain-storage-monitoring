# IoT Smart Grain Storage Monitor – PIR Motion Detection

## Description
This project demonstrates a PIR motion sensor simulation using Tinkercad.
It is a part of an IoT-based Smart Grain Storage Monitoring and Pest Control system.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno (Simulated in Tinkercad)
- PIR Motion Sensor
- LED
- Resistor
- Breadboard

## Working
- PIR sensor detects rodent movement
- Arduino reads the digital signal
- LED turns ON when motion is detected
- Used to indicate pest activity in grain storage
